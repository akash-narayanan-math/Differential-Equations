    % Trench 3.1 #7
    \begin{problem}[Trench 3.1.7]
        Use Euler's method with step sizes $h = 0.1, h = 0.05$, and $h = 0.025$
        to find approximate values of the solution of the initial value problem
        \[
            y' + \frac{2}{x}y = \frac{3}{x^3} + 1, \quad y(1) = 1
        \] 
        at $x = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, \ldots, 2.0.$ Compare these approximate
        values with the values of the exact solution
        \[
            y = \frac{1}{3x^2}(9 \ln x + x^3 + 2),
        \] 
        which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1. Present your results
        in a table like Table 3.1.1.

    % Trench 3.2 #7
    \begin{problem}[Trench 3.2.7]
        Use the improved Euler method with step sizes $h = 0.1, h = 0.05$, and
        $h = 0.025$ to find approximate values of the solution of the initial
        value problem
        \[
            y' + \frac{2}{x}y = \frac{3}{x^3} + 1, \quad y(1) = 1
        \] 
        at $x = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, \ldots, 2.0.$ Compare these approximate
        values with the values of the exact solution
        \[
            y = \frac{1}{3x^2}(9 \ln x + x^3 + 2),
        \] 
        which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1. Present your results
        in a table like Table 3.2.2.

    % Trench 3.3 #7
    \begin{problem}[Trench 3.3.7]
        Use the Runge-Kutta method with step sizes $h = 0.1, h = 0.05$, and
        $h = 0.025$ to find approximate values of the solution of the initial
        value problem
        \[
            y' + \frac{2}{x}y = \frac{3}{x^3} + 1, \quad y(1) = 1
        \] 
        at $x = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, \ldots, 2.0.$ Compare these approximate
        values with the values of the exact solution
        \[
            y = \frac{1}{3x^2}(9 \ln x + x^3 + 2),
        \] 
        which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1. Present your results
        in a table like Table 3.3.1.
